    </header>
    Favorite Bible Verse: Proverbs 3:5-6 <br>
    "This Bible Verse states,'Trust in the Lord with all your heart 
    and lean not on your own understanding; in all your ways submit 
    to him, and he will make your paths straight.' This is my life verse 
    for it always reminds me, to always trust in the Lord and not to lean on
    my own understanding for the  Lord knows what's the best for me so I always
    trust in Him."<br>

    Favorite Motto: "Use your smile to change a world. Don't let the world
    change your smile."<br>
    "That is my favorite motto for I believe that once we spread happiness
    in the world it can brought a big and positive impact to all of us"<br>
